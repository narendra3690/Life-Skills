### Question 1: What is Deep Work?
Deep Work is the ability to focus without distraction on a cognitively demanding task.

It involves working in a state of deep concentration where your mind is fully engaged, leading to high-quality output, faster learning, and meaningful progress.

Cal Newport defines it as “professional activities performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that push your cognitive abilities to their limit.”

### Question 2: According to the author, how to do deep work properly? 
* Schedule deep work sessions in your day (don’t wait for motivation).
* Eliminate distractions — no phone, no notifications, no social media.
* Work with intensity during the deep work period.
* Have a clear goal for each deep work session.
* Use rituals like specific locations, time blocks, and rules to enter deep focus.
* Embrace boredom — don’t switch to distraction when your brain feels uncomfortable.
* Quit shallow work (low-value busywork) as much as possible.
* Track your deep work hours to improve consistency.

### Question 3: How can you implement these principles in day-to-day life?
* Set two or three deep-work blocks per day (even 30 mins each is good).
* Keep your phone in another room while working.
* Start work with a clear plan: “What exactly will I accomplish in this session?”
* Use noise-canceling headphones or a quiet place.
* Reduce time on social media or set fixed time windows for it.
* Plan your day the night before with specific focus periods.
* Protect mornings for deep work because your mind is freshest.
* End the day with a shutdown routine so your brain can recover.

### Question 4: What are the dangers of social media?
* Addiction and loss of focus due to constant stimulation.
* Reduced attention span from rapid switching between tasks.
* Comparison and self-esteem issues from curated online lives.
* Increased anxiety and stress from notifications and dopamine loops.
* Reduced deep work ability because the brain becomes trained for distraction.
* Time loss — hours spent scrolling that could be used productively.
* Sleep problems due to screen exposure and mental overstimulation.

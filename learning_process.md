# Learning Process

### Question 1 - What is the Feynman Technique?
The Feynman Technique is a learning method where you ensure you truly understand a concept by explaining it in simple terms, as if teaching it to someone else.

### Question 2 - what was the most interesting story or idea for you?
One of the most interesting stories was how the surrealist painter Salvador Dali used the "diffuse mode" of thinking. He would sit in a chair with keys in his hand and relax until he dozed off; the moment he fell asleep, the keys would fall and clatter, waking him up so he could capture the creative ideas generated during that relaxed state.

### Question 3 - What are active and diffused modes of thinking?
* **Active (Focused) Mode:** A state of concentrated attention where thoughts move smoothly along familiar neural pathways, used when working on problems or concepts you are already familiar with.
* **Diffuse Mode:** A relaxed, resting state (like day-dreaming or sleep) where thoughts can range widely to form new connections, allowing the brain to grapple with completely new ideas or perspectives.

### Question 4 - what are the steps to take when approaching a new topic?
* Deconstruct the skill.
* Learn enough to self-correct.
* Remove barriers to practice.
* Practice for at least 20 hours.

### Question 5 - What are some of the actions you can take going forward to improve your learning process?
* **Practice Deep Work:** Work with 100% involvement and concentrated attention.
* **Eliminate Distractions:** Keep your phone on silent, remove home screen notifications, and block social media during work hours.
* **Track Your Time:** Use apps like Boosted to monitor productivity.
* **Active Reinforcement:** Try to explain concepts in your own words or teach them to others to verify your understanding.
* **Hands-on Implementation:** Always try to implement the concept in code or design.
* **Proactive Communication:** Clearly communicate about obstacles and difficulties as they arise.

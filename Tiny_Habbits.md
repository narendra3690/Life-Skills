# Tiny Habits

### 1. What was the most interesting story or idea for you?

Answer:  
The most interesting idea was starting with ridiculously small actions, like doing just one push-up or flossing one tooth, so the habit feels easy, automatic, and grows naturally over time instead of relying on big motivation.

### 2. How can you use B = MAP to make making new habits easier? What are M, A and P?

Answer:  
B = MAP means a Behavior happens when Motivation, Ability, and a Prompt come together.  
- M = Motivation (how much you want to do it)  
- A = Ability (how easy it is to do)  
- P = Prompt (the reminder/cue).  
To make new habits easier, lower the difficulty (increase Ability), tie them to a clear Prompt (like “after I brush my teeth…”), and don’t depend too much on Motivation.

### 3. Why is it important to "Shine" or Celebrate after each successful completion of a habit?

Answer:  
Celebrating makes you feel a quick positive emotion right after doing the habit, and that feeling is what tells your brain “this is good, do it again.” The “shine” moment wires the habit faster, keeps motivation alive, and makes even tiny actions feel like real wins.

### 4. What was the most interesting story or idea for you?

Answer:  
The most interesting idea was that getting just 1% better each day compounds into huge improvement over time, while getting 1% worse also compounds in the opposite direction, so tiny choices every day quietly shape your future.

### 5. What is the book's perspective about Identity?

Answer:  
The book says true change comes from focusing on identity, not just goals: instead of “I want to run a marathon,” think “I am a runner.” Every small habit becomes a vote for the kind of person you believe you are, and identity-based habits are more stable and powerful.

### 6. Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit easier to do?

Answer:  
The book suggests:  
- Make it obvious (clear cue in your environment).  
- Make it easy (reduce friction, small first step, prepare things in advance).  
- Use the 2-minute rule: scale the habit down to a version you can do in two minutes.  
This lowers resistance so you actually start and repeat it.

### 7. Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit harder to do?

Answer:  
The book suggests:  
- Make it invisible (remove cues from your environment).  
- Make it unattractive (remind yourself of the costs).  
- Make it difficult (add steps, friction, delays).  
- Make it uns satisfying (add consequences or remove rewards).  
This breaks the automatic loop and reduces how often you do it.

### 8. What are the steps you can take to make the cue obvious, or the habit more attractive, easy, or the response satisfying?

Answer:  
Habit: Daily focused coding practice (e.g., 30 minutes of DSA).  
Steps:  
- Cue obvious: Always code right after morning coffee at the same desk.  
- Make it attractive: Pair it with a good playlist and track streaks.  
- Make it easy: Prepare IDE, problem list, and notes the night before; start with just 5–10 minutes.  
- Make it satisfying: Mark it as “done” on a tracker and briefly celebrate the completion.

### 9. What are the steps you can take to make the cue invisible or the process unattractive, hard, or the response unsatisfying?

Answer:  
Habit: Mindless phone scrolling during work/study.  
Steps:  
- Make cue invisible: Keep the phone in another room or in a drawer.  
- Make it unattractive: Turn screen grayscale, remove addictive apps from home screen.  
- Make it hard: Log out, enable app limits, or uninstall during work hours.  
- Make it unsatisfying: Use an accountability partner or commit to a small penalty if you break the rule.

# Good Practices for Software Development

## Question 1: Which point(s) were new to you?

* **Public Channel Priority:** The idea that communicating in group channels is better than private DMs to ensure "more eyes" are on the problem and information remains transparent.
* **The 5-Minute Call-Back:** Learning to answer a call even if I’m busy just to acknowledge the person and set a call-back time, rather than letting it go to "Missed Call."
* **Requirements Verification:** The strategy of writing down my own version of the requirements and sharing them back with the team to force immediate feedback and alignment.
* **Deep Work as a Skill:** Viewing focus not just as a habit but as a skill that requires specific tools (like app blockers or food management) to preserve.

## Question 2: Which area do you think you need to improve on? What are your ideas to make progress in that area?

### Area 1: Asking High-Quality Questions
**The Problem:** Sometimes I ask for help without providing enough context, which slows down the resolution.

**Action Plan:**
* **Template:** I will use a "Context-First" format: Describe the goal, show the error (screenshot/Loom), and list what I have already tried.
* **Artifacts:** I will use GitHub Gists or CodeSandboxes instead of pasting long, unformatted code blocks in chat.

### Area 2: Deep Work & Attention Management
**The Problem:** Distractions from social media or phone notifications can break my concentration during implementation.

**Action Plan:**
* **Digital Hygiene:** I will use tools like **Freedom** or **TimeLimit** to block non-work apps during my core coding hours.
* **Time Tracking:** I will start using the **Boosted** app to track my productivity and identify when my energy levels are highest.

### Area 3: Over-Communication
**The Problem:** I sometimes wait until a deadline is missed to report a blocker.

**Action Plan:**
* **Proactive Reporting:** As soon as an unexpected issue arises that might shift a deadline, I will update the relevant channel immediately rather than waiting for the daily sync.
* **Video Presence:** I will keep my video turned on in meetings to build better rapport and engagement with the team.
Phone on silent/notifications off.

# Prevention of Sexual Harassment

---

### 1. What kinds of behaviour cause sexual harassment?

Sexual harassment is defined as any **unwelcome** conduct of a sexual nature that is severe or pervasive enough to affect working conditions or create a hostile environment. The behaviors are generally categorized into three forms:

* **Verbal:** This includes sexual or gender-based jokes, comments about a person's body or clothing, requesting sexual favors, spreading rumors about someone's sexual life, or using obscene language.
* **Visual:** Examples include displaying posters, drawings, or screensavers of a sexual nature, as well as sending sexually suggestive emails or texts.
* **Physical:** This encompasses inappropriate touching (such as kissing, hugging, or stroking), impeding movement, sexual gestures, and leering or staring.

### 2. What would you do in case you face or witness any incident or repeated incidents of such behaviour?

If you experience or witness harassment, you should take the following actions:

* **Tell the person to stop:** Directly and firmly state that the behavior is unwelcome and must end immediately.
* **Report the incident:** If the behavior continues or if you are uncomfortable confronting the individual, follow your organization's formal grievance procedure.
* **Follow the chain of command:** Report the matter to your supervisor. If the supervisor is the harasser, escalate the report to their superior, Human Resources, or another trusted person in the chain of command.
* **Documentation:** It is recommended to document what happened, including specific dates, times, and what was said or done.
* **Legal Protections:** Be aware that organizations are legally prohibited from retaliating against employees who lodge a complaint in good faith, and confidentiality is maintained to the greatest extent possible.

#  Grit and Growth Mindset

## 1.  Grit
**Grit** is described as a powerful combination of **long-term passion** and **perseverance**.  
The video explains that success depends less on talent or IQ and more on the ability to stay committed over many years — continuing to practice, push forward after failures, and stay dedicated to meaningful goals.

## 2.  Growth Mindset
A **growth mindset** is the belief that skills and intelligence can be developed through **effort, good strategies, and feedback**.  
The video contrasts this with a fixed mindset and emphasizes that people grow most when they **embrace challenges**, learn from mistakes, and use criticism to improve.

## 3.  What is the Internal Locus of Control?
**Internal locus of control** means believing that your actions, habits, and decisions strongly influence your outcomes.  
The video’s key message: when you focus on what you *can* control — such as effort, routines, and learning — your motivation increases and progress feels more attainable and self-driven.

## 5.  My Action Plan to Build a Growth Mindset
- View bugs and failures as **feedback**, not proof of incompetence.  
- Choose slightly harder problems or new technologies to push beyond comfort zones.  
- Track **effort-based goals** (hours practiced, tasks attempted) — not just results.  
- Invite code reviews and switch from “I can’t do this” → “I can’t do this *yet*.”  
- Maintain a simple learning roadmap and review progress every week.
